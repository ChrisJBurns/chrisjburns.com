Welcome to my blog! Over the course of the last year and a half I have contributed to the [Capgemini Engineering blog](https://capgemini.github.io/authors/#author-chris-burns) a number of times and I finally thought it was about time that I created my own. This website has been created with the intention of hosting my blog. I have no doubt that in the future it will grow into a multi-purpose website with the core attraction being the blog.

# What will I be writing about?
So if you've read any of my posts on the Capgemini Engineering blog, you would have noticed that I am an engineer with many interests. From software design and development all the way up to the delivery of it to production - and all the bits in between. I try to involve myself in all aspects of the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) offering any help when needed whilst also trying to absorb as much as I can with regard to what works best.

My blog will consist of a variety of topics; from how-to-dos to documenting additions I make to the website to anything that I want to get off my chest. I will try to keep it entirely technological - although I can't promise I won't stray into other areas.

Stay tuned!
